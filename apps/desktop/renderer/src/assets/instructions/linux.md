# We're thrilled to have you!

Before you dive in, let's quickly go over how Squigit integrates with your system, how to get started, and how we protect your data.

## 1. Linux Package Setup (Required)

Squigit on Linux expects `squigit-ocr` and `squigit-stt` to be installed from the Squigit package repository.

### Debian/Ubuntu (APT)

```bash
# 1) add repo
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://squigit-org.github.io/squigit-packages/keys/squigit-packages.asc | \
  gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/squigit-packages.gpg >/dev/null
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/squigit-packages.gpg] https://squigit-org.github.io/squigit-packages/apt stable ocr stt" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/squigit-packages.list >/dev/null

# 2) update
sudo apt update

# 3) install
sudo apt install squigit-ocr squigit-stt
```

### Fedora/RHEL (DNF)

```bash
# 1) add repo
sudo curl -fsSL https://squigit-org.github.io/squigit-packages/rpm/squigit.repo \
  -o /etc/yum.repos.d/squigit.repo

# 2) update
sudo dnf makecache

# 3) install
sudo dnf install squigit-ocr squigit-stt
```

## 2. Global Shortcuts & System Tray

We've attempted to register `Super+Shift+A` with your desktop environment so you can trigger a capture from anywhere. Go ahead and press it to test it out!

**Important:** For this to work instantly, Squigit needs to stay running in your system tray. It's incredibly lightweight, so you can safely leave it alive 24/7 to guarantee a rapid response when you need it.

Because Linux environments vary wildly, automated installation sometimes fails on specific setups (especially Wayland). If the shortcut didn't work, we recommend manually copying this command:

```bash
/bin/sh -lc 'dbus-send --session --type=method_call --dest=com.squigit.app /com/squigit/app com.squigit.app.Capture >/dev/null 2>&1 || busctl --user call com.squigit.app /com/squigit/app com.squigit.app Capture >/dev/null 2>&1 || gdbus call --session --dest com.squigit.app --object-path /com/squigit/app --method com.squigit.app.Capture >/dev/null 2>&1'
```

1.  Go to your system **Settings -\> Keyboard -\> View and Customize Shortcuts**.
2.  Create a new custom shortcut.
3.  Paste the command above into the "Command" field.
4.  Set the binding to `Super+Shift+A` (or whatever you prefer).

Alternatively, you can bind this command using third-party tools like `sxhkd`, `input-remapper`, or `xbindkeys` (though `xbindkeys` is unreliable on Wayland).

## 3. Quick Start

Once you agree to this guide, the login button will activate. Continue with Google to set up your local profile, and you're ready to go!

- **Capture & Upload:** Use your shortcut, press `Ctrl+V` to paste, or simply drag and drop an image into the app.
- **On-Device OCR:** Squigit extracts text locally on your machine. You can download additional language models in **Settings -> Models**.
- **AI & Reverse Search:** To unlock AI overviews and reverse image search, configure your Bring Your Own Key (BYOK) setup in **Settings -> API Keys**.
- **Make it Yours:** Tailor your AI's responses and behavior in **Settings -> Personalization**.

## 4. Security & Privacy

Because Squigit analyzes your screen, your privacy is our absolute highest priority. We use a zero-trust architecture:

- **Local First:** Your images, chats, and data never leave your device unless you explicitly trigger an AI feature.
- **Encrypted Keys:** Your API keys are hashed and stored locally using AES-256 encryption. We cannot read them, ever.
- **Stateless API Requests:** When you use AI features, requests are sent directly to your provider statelessly. Providers do not get your full context or history.
- **Google OAuth:** We use Google sign-in purely for local profile isolation. We only fetch your account name and avatar to personalize your app experience.
- **⚠️ Lens Feature Warning:** Reverse image search uses ImgBB as a temporary, free image host to process the search. **Do not use the Lens feature for images containing sensitive personal data.**

## 5. Help & Support

Need assistance or want to report a bug? Head over to **Settings -> Help & Support**.

There, you can view your system diagnostics, report bugs, visit our GitHub, or contact us directly. Note: When you contact support, some basic system information (like your OS, Squigit version, and backend engine status) may be sent to help us troubleshoot your issue faster, subject to our **[Privacy Policy](https://github.com/a7mddra/squigit/blob/main/docs/06-policies/SECURITY.md)**.
